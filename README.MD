## Project
The goal of this project is to make a connect-four game in Rust. We want to have local multiplayer, multiplayer over the internet, and singleplayer against an AI. All of this underneath a pretty UI. This will allow us to learn about front and back end web dev in Rust (yew), machine learning in rust, a connect four algorithm, and we anticipate we will need multithreading either for managing inter-user communication, training of the AI, or both.
### Technical Overview
**TODO**
#### Checkpoint 1 (11/5)
 - Full website layout with routing and and UI.
 - Directive on-screen messages, like "red wins", or "yellow's turn".
 - Game mechanics (placing pieces, stop once someone wins, etc.).
 - Undo button to revert the board state (even to the start of the game).
#### Checkpoint 2 (11/30)
Almost done:
 - Online Multiplayer
 - AI that *at least* works. Ideally we would have our perfect AI mostly done.
 - AI plays in the background against itself on the home screen.
#### End (12/5)
**TODO**

### Random Ideas
 - Let the player select which column to drop a disk into by entering a number.
 - Survival mode !!!
 - Undo move option (would need to store move history)
